##  B. ABSTRACT 

Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money, based on blockchain technology. A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or the Euro, there is no central authority that manages and maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. Instead, these tasks are broadly distributed among a cryptocurrencyâ€™s users via the internet.
As for now, you as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer or Practitioner are going to use AI technology to recognize people whether they are wearing face mask or not in the public or open space.
